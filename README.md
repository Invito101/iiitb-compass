##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A PostgreSQL DB (or use SQLite for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Invito101/iiitb-compass.git
cd iiitb-compass/client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force

It is important to use --force here

 3.  Configure Environment Variables

In the `.env` file inside the repo, make sure to properly configure the following values:

```env
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=***
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=***
```

 Follow these guides to set up GitHub OAuth and integrate Auth.js with Prisma:

-  [Auth.js Installation Guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation)  
-  [GitHub OAuth Setup](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/authentication/oauth#github)  
-  [Prisma Adapter Setup](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/adapters/prisma)

---

```env
AUTH_SECRET=***
```

- Generate a **random string** and paste it here.  
  You can use [this tool](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) or any method you like to generate one.

---

```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- Set this to the **URL where your dev server runs**, usually `http://localhost:3000` during local development.

---

```env
DATABASE_URL=***
```

To get your database URL:

 - Sign up at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up)  
 - Follow the links below to connect your Neon database, and get your :  
    https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/signing-up
    https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/connect-neon

And add your database URL to the variable






4. Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

5. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then go to **http://localhost:3000/auth** and sign up with github to begin.
